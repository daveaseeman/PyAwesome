3Principle 1. Segmentation 
A -Divide an object into independent parts
Gator-grip socket spanner 
Multi-pin connectors 
Bubble-wrap 
Have a range of different focal length lenses for a
 camera 
Multiple pistons in an internal combustion engine 
Multi-enginedaircraft 
Pocket-spring mattress 
Stratification of different constituents inside a c
hemical process vessel 
B -Make an object easy to assemble or disassemble
Rapid-release bicycle saddle/wheel/etc fasteners 
Quick disconnect joints in plumbing and hydraulic sy
stems 
Single fastener V-band clamps on flange joints 
Loose-leaf paper in a ring-binder 
C -Increase the degree of fragmentation or segmenta
tion
Use of multiple control surfaces on aerodynamic struc
tures 
16 and 24 valve versus 8 valve internal combustion e
ngines 
Multi-blade cartridge razors 
Multi-zone combustion systems 
Build up a component from layers (e.g. stereo-lithogr
aphy, welds, etc)

4Principle 2. Taking Out
A -Separate an interfering part or property from an
 object, or 
single out the only necessary part (or property) of
 an object
Locate a noisy compressor outside the building where
 the compressed air is 
used 
Use the sound of a barking dog, without the dog, as
 a burglar alarm 
Scarecrow 
Non-smoking areas in restaurants or in railway carri
ages
Automation removes humans
